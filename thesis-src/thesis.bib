  title     = {Induction-Recursion, A polymorphic representation},
  abstract = {Inductive-recursive definitions originated as a way of defining universes in type theory. They turn out to be useful in other contexts, like the definition of data types with recursive constraints and the characterisation of general recursion in a total setting. In fact, they are very common in algorithmics, although this fact is not often noticed. Many advanced data structures are defined as inductive types, often trees, with side conditions guaranteeing their correctness and efficiency. these conditions are recursively defined on the data itself. I will illustrate this by showing how leftist heaps, an optimal implementation of priority queues, are in fact an inductive-recursive type. If these definitions are not provided by our type theory, we must find a way to encode them. In a polymorphic lambda calculus, we can define them by universally quantifying over the type and the functions on it. This idea can be abstracted and we can see inductive-recursive structures as the initial objects of a comma category. I will illustrate this in the specific case of leftist trees.
