  abstract       = "Evolutionary testing has been widely studied as a technique for automating 
                    the process of test case generation. However, to date, there has been no theoretical 
                    examination of when and why it works. Furthermore, the empirical evidence for the 
                    effectiveness of evolutionary testing consists largely of small scale laboratory 
                    studies. This paper presents a first theoretical analysis of the scenarios in which 
                    evolutionary algorithms are suitable for structural test case generation. The theory 
                    is backed up by an empirical study that considers real world programs, the search 
                    spaces of which are several orders of magnitude larger than those previously 
                    considered.",

at a finite temperature) and multivariate or combinatorial optimization (finding the minimum of a given function depending on many parameters). A detailed 
analogy with annealing in solids provides a framework for optimization of the properties of very large and complex systems. This connection to statistical 
mechanics exposes new information and provides an unfamiliar perspective on traditional optimization problems and methods.},
